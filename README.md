vimrc
=====

my .vimrc and .vim directory

Contents
---------

* `_vimrc` --- .vimrc
* `_vim` --- .vim directory

usage
-----

clone the git by:  
     `git clone --recursive https://github.com/gdzhu/vimrc`  
then copy .vim directory and .vimrc to your home folder and enjoy Viming! Vim will try to fetch required plugins from github the first time you run it  

NOTE: the `--recursive` option is required to clone the submodule in the repo, or you need to update the submodule manually by  
`git submodule init`  
and  
`git submodule update`  
in the cloned repo dir.

**always remember to backup your own stuff.
